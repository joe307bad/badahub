# BadaHub üè†
.NET Core/Angular/WebSocket home automation platform for the Bada household

### Household as Code
This project is an experiment in building a home automation platform using an amalgamation of technologies. After studying the topic of "infrastructure as code," I wondered what it would be like to build a "household as code;" a series of moving peices and projects that could be easily deployed, managed, and customized. Together, these peices would form a single purpose: household/home server automation and monitoring.
